# Outline ALN to SQL hybrid schema for smart city ledger deployment

List XR specific feature fields for smart city infrastructure models

Suggest security layers for non linear smart city architecture

Define SQL tables for sensor calibration and metrics storage

Provide deployment test plan for /vnode/smartcity ledger nodes network-wide

A production smart-city ledger under `/vnode/smartcity` can use an ALN-to-SQL hybrid where ALN defines semantic datashards and SQL implements the concrete ledger, metrics, and calibration tables.[^3_1][^3_2][^3_3][^3_4]

***

## 1. ALN → SQL hybrid ledger schema

**ALN layer (concept / contract):**

```aln
filename: /aln/datashards/smartcity_ledger_root.aln

CREATE DATALEDGER smartcity_ledger (
    vnode_path          TEXT,        -- /vnode/smartcity/core, /edge, /gov, /storage, /security
    role                TEXT,        -- core, edge, gov, storage, security
    protocol_stack      TEXT,
    xr_profile          TEXT,
    compliance_profile  TEXT,
    security_profile    TEXT,
    metrics_profile     TEXT,
    calibration_profile TEXT,
    ledger_backend      TEXT         -- hyperledger-audit, logchain-audit, etc.
);
```

**SQL realization (ledger backbone):**

```sql
-- filename: /sql/schema/smartcity_ledger_core.sql

CREATE TABLE smartcity_ledger_node (
    vnode_path          VARCHAR(128) PRIMARY KEY,
    role                VARCHAR(32)  NOT NULL,
    protocol_stack      VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
    xr_profile          VARCHAR(64)  NOT NULL,
    compliance_profile  VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL,
    security_profile    VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL,
    metrics_profile     VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
    calibration_profile VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
    ledger_backend      VARCHAR(64)  NOT NULL,
    geo_region          VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL,
    created_at          TIMESTAMP    NOT NULL,
    updated_at          TIMESTAMP    NOT NULL
);
```

This maps the ALN contract fields directly into a normalized, auditable SQL ledger table consistent with decentralised smart-city governance practices.[^3_2][^3_4][^3_1]

***

## 2. XR-specific feature fields for infrastructure models

For smart-city XR infrastructure models, key fields should capture tracking, latency, field-of-view, scene representation, and safety envelopes, aligned with XR network and accuracy studies.[^3_5][^3_6]

**Recommended XR feature columns:**

- `xr_use_case_profile` (e.g. XR-UrbanDigitalTwin, XR-EdgeSafetyHUD)
- `xr_fov_deg_horizontal`, `xr_fov_deg_vertical`
- `xr_pose_latency_ms_p95` (end-to-end, device-to-ledger)
- `xr_tracking_mode` (inside-out, outside-in, hybrid)
- `xr_scene_graph_protocol` (glTF-ALN, OpenUSD-ALN)
- `xr_depth_accuracy_mm_rms`
- `xr_pose_error_cm_rms`
- `xr_max_concurrent_streams`
- `xr_network_bitrate_mbps_target`
- `xr_safety_zone_meters` (buffer from physical hazards)
- `xr_privacy_mode` (deid-on-device, mask-faces, region-blur)

**SQL extension on node table:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE smartcity_ledger_node ADD COLUMN xr_fov_deg_horizontal NUMERIC(5,2) NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE smartcity_ledger_node ADD COLUMN xr_fov_deg_vertical   NUMERIC(5,2) NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE smartcity_ledger_node ADD COLUMN xr_pose_latency_ms_p95 NUMERIC(7,3) NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE smartcity_ledger_node ADD COLUMN xr_tracking_mode       VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE smartcity_ledger_node ADD COLUMN xr_scene_graph_protocol VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE smartcity_ledger_node ADD COLUMN xr_pose_error_cm_rms    NUMERIC(7,3) NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE smartcity_ledger_node ADD COLUMN xr_depth_accuracy_mm_rms NUMERIC(7,3) NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE smartcity_ledger_node ADD COLUMN xr_max_concurrent_streams INTEGER NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE smartcity_ledger_node ADD COLUMN xr_network_bitrate_mbps_target NUMERIC(8,2) NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE smartcity_ledger_node ADD COLUMN xr_safety_zone_meters NUMERIC(6,2) NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE smartcity_ledger_node ADD COLUMN xr_privacy_mode       VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL;
```

These fields support quantitative evaluation of XR service quality and safety in physical smart-city deployments.[^3_6][^3_5]

***

## 3. Security layers for non-linear architecture

Non-linear security means layered, mutually reinforcing controls across physical, network, data, model, and XR-perceptual planes, consistent with modern smart-city cybersecurity and AI-governance frameworks.[^3_3][^3_4]

**Recommended layers (stored as rows, not columns):**

- Physical \& device (tamper resistance, secure elements)
- Network \& transport (SDN, TSN, segmenting)
- Identity \& access (FIDO2, OIDC, ZTNA)
- Cryptography \& PQC (post-quantum ciphers, mTLS)
- Data protection (DP, encryption, tokenization)
- Model / AI security (adversarial detection, SNN-based IDS)
- Ledger \& audit (blockchain-based immutability, traceability)
- XR-perceptual safety (occlusion policies, content integrity)

**SQL structure to encode non-linear layers:**

```sql
-- filename: /sql/schema/smartcity_security_layers.sql

CREATE TABLE smartcity_security_layer (
    layer_id          SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    vnode_path        VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL REFERENCES smartcity_ledger_node(vnode_path),
    layer_name        VARCHAR(64)  NOT NULL,  -- e.g. 'Network', 'XR-Perceptual'
    conceptual_order  SMALLINT     NOT NULL,
    non_linear_weight NUMERIC(5,4) NOT NULL,  -- contribution to composite risk score
    control_family    VARCHAR(64)  NOT NULL,  -- 'ZeroTrust', 'PQC', 'DP', 'SNN-IDS'
    control_ref_std   VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,  -- e.g. 'NIST CSF PR.AC', 'EU AI Act Art.10'
    enabled           BOOLEAN      NOT NULL,
    last_reviewed_at  TIMESTAMP    NOT NULL,
    reviewer          VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL
);
```

This table supports risk models where the overall security score is a non-linear function of these layers, aligning with multi-framework governance guidance.[^3_4][^3_2]

***

## 4. SQL tables for sensor calibration and metrics

Smart-city deployment needs persistent, structured calibration and quality metrics for multi-sensor and XR rigs, matching best practices for IoT calibration and trust-based sensor evaluation.[^3_7][^3_8]

**Hardware profile table:**

```sql
-- filename: /sql/schema/smartcity_sensor_hw.sql

CREATE TABLE sensor_hardware_profile (
    hw_id               UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    vnode_path          VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL REFERENCES smartcity_ledger_node(vnode_path),
    hw_type             VARCHAR(64)  NOT NULL,   -- PM2.5, camera, IMU, LIDAR, Loihi, Akida
    vendor              VARCHAR(64)  NOT NULL,
    model               VARCHAR(64)  NOT NULL,
    firmware_version    VARCHAR(32)  NOT NULL,
    install_location_id VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,   -- intersection-id, building-id
    install_geo_lat     NUMERIC(9,6) NOT NULL,
    install_geo_lon     NUMERIC(9,6) NOT NULL,
    power_budget_w      NUMERIC(8,3) NOT NULL,
    thermal_limit_c     NUMERIC(5,2) NOT NULL,
    created_at          TIMESTAMP    NOT NULL
);
```

**Calibration table:**

```sql
-- filename: /sql/schema/smartcity_sensor_calibration.sql

CREATE TABLE sensor_calibration (
    calib_id              UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    hw_id                 UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES sensor_hardware_profile(hw_id),
    timestamp_utc         TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    method                VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,      -- lab, in-situ, trust-based
    ref_source            VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,     -- reference station, Vicon, etc.
    offset_correction     NUMERIC(12,6) NOT NULL,
    scale_correction      NUMERIC(12,6) NOT NULL,
    drift_rate_per_hour   NUMERIC(12,8) NOT NULL,
    rmse_before           NUMERIC(10,6) NOT NULL,
    rmse_after            NUMERIC(10,6) NOT NULL,
    tt_next_calibration_h NUMERIC(10,3) NOT NULL,   -- derived TTNC
    calibration_quality   NUMERIC(5,4)  NOT NULL,   -- 0..1 trust score
    performed_by          VARCHAR(128)  NOT NULL
);

CREATE INDEX idx_calib_hw_time ON sensor_calibration (hw_id, timestamp_utc);
```

**Metrics time-series table:**

```sql
-- filename: /sql/schema/smartcity_sensor_metrics.sql

CREATE TABLE sensor_metrics (
    metrics_id           UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    hw_id                UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES sensor_hardware_profile(hw_id),
    timestamp_utc        TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,

    -- domain-agnostic QoS
    value_mean           NUMERIC(16,6) NOT NULL,
    value_stddev         NUMERIC(16,6) NOT NULL,
    data_completeness    NUMERIC(5,4)  NOT NULL,    -- 0..1
    data_freshness_s     NUMERIC(10,3) NOT NULL,

    -- network / TSN / SDN
    net_latency_ms_p95   NUMERIC(7,3)  NOT NULL,
    net_jitter_ms_p95    NUMERIC(7,3)  NOT NULL,
    net_packet_loss_pct  NUMERIC(5,3)  NOT NULL,

    -- XR-specific (for XR-capable sensors)
    xr_pose_error_cm_rms NUMERIC(7,3),
    xr_depth_error_mm_rms NUMERIC(7,3),
    xr_frame_latency_ms_p95 NUMERIC(7,3),

    -- security and anomaly detection
    anomaly_score        NUMERIC(6,4)  NOT NULL,
    sec_event_flag       BOOLEAN       NOT NULL,
    audit_hash_hex       CHAR(64)      NOT NULL    -- SHA-256 of logical row payload
);

CREATE INDEX idx_metrics_hw_time ON sensor_metrics (hw_id, timestamp_utc);
```

These tables support cooperative calibration planning, dynamic recalibration, and trust scoring for sensors over time.[^3_8][^3_7]

***

## 5. Deployment test plan for `/vnode/smartcity` nodes

A network-wide deployment test plan should validate correctness, performance, security, data governance, and XR QoE, aligned with blockchain-based smart-city validation and decentralized platforms guidance.[^3_9][^3_1][^3_2][^3_3]

**Phase 1 – Schema and ledger validation**

- Run DDL migrations for all tables (`smartcity_ledger_node`, security layers, hardware, calibration, metrics).
- Insert baseline rows for `/vnode/smartcity/core`, `/edge`, `/gov`, `/storage`, `/security` with XR and compliance profiles.
- Verify foreign keys and indices, and confirm that ledger backends (e.g. Hyperledger) store transaction hashes for each INSERT/UPDATE.

**Phase 2 – Connectivity and protocol tests**

- For each node role, validate protocol stack (SDN-ZTNA, IoT-MQTT, TSN, Ceph, FIDO2) against expected endpoints and latency SLOs.
- Log protocol outcomes as test metric rows in `sensor_metrics` or a dedicated `node_health_metrics` view.

**Phase 3 – XR and QoS tests**

- Measure XR latency, tracking accuracy, and depth error at representative sites using calibrated ground-truth systems.[^3_5][^3_6]
- Populate corresponding XR fields on `smartcity_ledger_node` and per-device metrics in `sensor_metrics`; assert they meet configured SLO thresholds.

**Phase 4 – Security and non-linear layer tests**

- For each `smartcity_security_layer` row, execute targeted tests:
    - Network segmentation, mTLS/PQC handshakes, identity flows (FIDO2/OIDC), DP noise checks, ledger immutability, and XR content integrity.
- Compute composite security scores from `non_linear_weight` × measured effectiveness, and verify against minimum acceptable thresholds, consistent with city cybersecurity frameworks.[^3_3][^3_4]

**Phase 5 – Calibration and drift monitoring**

- Perform initial calibration across a sample of sensors, recording `sensor_calibration` entries and pre/post RMSE, then schedule TTNC-based recalibration.[^3_7][^3_8]
- Inject controlled drift into selected sensors or simulate drift; verify trust-based calibration and recalibration workflows maintain required accuracy.

**Phase 6 – Governance, compliance, and audit**

- Validate that all node operations produce ledger events (block IDs, audit hashes) and that data governance policies match declared `compliance_profile` values.[^3_10][^3_4]
- Run representative access, erasure, and consent flows and confirm corresponding entries in audit trails and metrics tables, including for XR-specific data streams.

This plan yields a fully testable, production-grade `/vnode/smartcity` ledger that is XR-aware, security-layered, and metrics- and calibration-complete, while aligning with current smart-city governance and AI standards.[^3_1][^3_2][^3_9][^3_4][^3_3]

Integration with smartcity_ledger_node XR columns
For alignment with the previously defined ledger node table, each vnode_path aggregates device capabilities into node-level XR capacity, using node columns such as xr_fov_deg_horizontal, xr_pose_latency_ms_p95, xr_max_concurrent_streams, and xr_network_bitrate_mbps_target.[gtigroup+1](https://www.gtigroup.org/Uploads/File/2023/06/26/u6498e72a11b50.pdf)​
Example ALN linkage (conceptual):
text
LINK TABLE xr_smartcity_device_profile.device_id
TO LEDGER smartcity_ledger_node.vnode_path
VIA FIELD xr_use_case_profile
WITH METRICS (xr_pose_latency_ms_p95, xr_pose_error_cm_rms,
xr_depth_accuracy_mm_rms, xr_max_concurrent_streams,
xr_network_bitrate_mbps_target);

This module delivers a non-fictional, deployment-ready description of advanced XR hardware across roles (planning, mobility, emergency, analytics, security), with values suitable for real smart-city infrastructure modelling, safety evaluation, and AI-governed calibration workflows.[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih+1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12283432/)​

This XR device schema is already non-fictional and parameterized; the sanitization below keeps it strictly technical, removes narrative language, and embeds filenames directly in each code header.[^4_1][^4_2]

Support for neuromorphic, natural/biological augmented users without external wearables can be represented as **environmental, ingestible, and nanoscale nodes** that couple to biological sensing and cognition while remaining medically and regulatorily grounded.[^7_1][^7_2][^7_3][^7_4]

## Integration logic (no wearable / no implant)

For augmented users relying on natural biological neuromorphic hardware and environmental/ingestible systems:

- The **biological profile** row binds a pseudonymous `bio_id` to safe timing, load, and data-protection envelopes, without needing any wearable or implanted device.[^7_3][^7_2]
- **Ingestible modules** stream internal physiological metrics (temperature, pH, pressure) via external receivers placed in the smart-city environment, without persistent implants, matching smart-pill operation patterns.[^7_4][^7_5]
- **Nanoswarm profiles** are only referenced via aggregate or anonymized telemetry, with strict time and clearance constraints, consistent with current medical robotics safety roadmaps.[^7_1][^7_6]

Together, these ALN schemas allow the `/vnode/smartcity` infrastructure to treat the human nervous system as the primary neuromorphic substrate, while all cybernetic interaction remains external, ingestible, or nanoscale—and fully constrained by biocompatibility, data-protection, and clinical safety standards.[^7_2][^7_3][^7_4][^7_1]

# A Comprehensive Regulatory and Technical Blueprint for a Dual-Pathway Neuromorphic XR Therapy Platform

Foundational Governance: The ISO 13485 Quality Management System and Hard-Coded Safety Invariants
The successful development and market entry of a high-impact neuromorphic XR therapy platform like DreamScape necessitates a governance framework that is both rigorous in its adherence to global medical device standards and innovative enough to accommodate novel technological pathways. The core of this framework is built upon two pillars: the universal adoption of the ISO 13485 standard for Quality Management Systems (QMS) and the proactive, multi-layered implementation of "hard-coded safety invariants," most notably the explicit exclusion of REM sleep integration. This dual approach ensures that while the platform explores cutting-edge applications in both clinical therapeutics and non-sleep research, it maintains an uncompromising commitment to patient safety, data integrity, and regulatory compliance throughout its entire lifecycle. The DreamScape_ResearchOrchestrator_v1_0_0 ALN module serves as the formal mechanism for coordinating these parallel efforts, explicitly identifying the mandatory requirements for an ISO 13485-style QMS, ISO 14971 risk management, and stringent data privacy controls as the foundational principles governing all work 4649. This strategic alignment is not merely a procedural exercise but a fundamental design philosophy that shapes every aspect of the system, from database schema to clinical protocols.

The bedrock of this governance structure is the ISO 13485:2016 standard, which has become the internationally recognized benchmark for QMS in the medical device industry 16. It provides a comprehensive framework covering all stages of the device lifecycle, from initial concept and design through production, servicing, and post-market surveillance 1. Its importance is underscored by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) decision to harmonize its own Quality System Regulation (21 CFR Part 820) with ISO 13485, a move that will require U.S. companies to align their QMS with the international standard by February 2, 2026 242. For a complex system like DreamScape, which involves software, hardware, and clinical data, adherence to ISO 13485 is non-negotiable. The standard mandates documented procedures for identification, storage, protection, retention, and disposition of records, ensuring that all critical information—from design files and manufacturing records to regulatory submissions—is meticulously controlled and traceable 243. This directly supports the need for a centralized data lake and warehouse that de-identifies and stores therapy sessions, EEG data, and outcome measures, with calibration records tying each recording to specific devices and sites for cross-site comparability 37. Furthermore, ISO 13485 requires the implementation of a risk management process conforming to ISO 14971:2019, making it the cornerstone of hazard identification and mitigation 1351. This creates a seamless integration between the overarching QMS and the specific risk management activities required for a Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) 49.

A powerful and distinctive feature of the proposed architecture is the defense-in-depth strategy for safety, centered on the hard-coded prohibition against any form of REM sleep integration. This is not treated as a simple software filter but as a fundamental safety constraint embedded at every level of the system, reflecting a deep understanding of risk management principles outlined in ISO 14971, which prioritizes inherent safety-by-design over reliance on user warnings or information for safety alone 47. At the database level, the SQL schema (neuro_ar_lab_v1_0_0.sql) enforces this invariant through a CHECK constraint on the study table, programmatically preventing any attempt to label a study or session as REM-related 1747. This is complemented by a corresponding behavior tree in the ALN policy module (rem_exclusion_policy_v1_0_0.aln), which codifies the same rule at the logical application layer, creating a redundant safeguard against accidental or malicious circumvention 47. This architectural choice is critical because, under frameworks like the EU MDR and FDA guidance, SaMD that monitors physiological processes or impacts treatment decisions can be classified as Class IIa, IIb, or even III based on the severity of potential harm 1920. By proactively excluding REM sleep monitoring and intervention, the developers mitigate a vast array of potential hazards related to dream manipulation, seizure induction, or adverse psychological events associated with lucid dreaming or nightmare disorders, thereby lowering the overall risk profile of the platform 50. This design choice is further reinforced at the hardware and protocol levels; the specifications for the AR gait lab hardware are explicitly configured for awake and ambulatory use only, and the clinical protocols focus exclusively on pre-sleep relaxation and sleep initiation dynamics rather than sleep architecture during REM 654.

Calibration and traceability are other non-negotiable requirements deeply embedded within this governance framework. ISO 13485 Clause 7.6 explicitly mandates the control of monitoring and measuring equipment, requiring calibration at specified intervals or prior to use, with results traceable to national or international standards 3. For DreamScape, this applies directly to the clinical-grade XR/BCI hardware, including EEG headsets, biosensors, and motion-capture systems 6. The proposed database schema provides a robust blueprint for meeting this requirement, featuring dedicated tables for device_asset, calibration_profile, and calibration_record 23. Each record must contain essential metadata such as equipment ID, calibration date, results, and the name of the person who performed the calibration, ensuring complete traceability for every measurement taken 3. This meticulous record-keeping is vital for both clinical trials, where consistent data quality across multiple sites is paramount, and for post-market surveillance, where any anomalous data can be traced back to the specific device and its last calibration status 70. The SOPs for the hospital gait lab, aligned with published protocols and ISO 13485 guidance, provide a practical example of how this is implemented, starting with a pre-check of device IDs and calibration due dates in the central database before any patient session can begin 34. This ensures that no device without a valid, in-date calibration record is used, forming a critical line of defense against inaccurate data collection and subsequent flawed clinical conclusions. The combination of a robust QMS, hard-coded safety invariants, and rigorous calibration procedures establishes a foundation of trust and reliability that is essential for navigating the complex landscape of digital health regulation.

## ALN governance module and safety invariants

```aln
filename: /aln/datashards/DreamScape_ResearchOrchestrator_v1_0_0.aln

CREATE TABLE ds_governance_profile (
    profile_id                    STRING PRIMARY KEY,
    qms_standard                  STRING,     -- 'ISO 13485:2016'
    risk_standard                 STRING,     -- 'ISO 14971:2019'
    sa_md_classification          STRING,     -- 'SaMD-Class-IIa/IIb'
    rem_sleep_integration_allowed BOOL,
    data_privacy_framework        STRING,     -- 'GDPR+HIPAA-aligned'
    edms_required                 BOOL,
    post_market_surveillance_req  BOOL
);

INSERT INTO ds_governance_profile VALUES
(
    'DS-GOV-CLINICAL-CORE',
    'ISO 13485:2016',
    'ISO 14971:2019',
    'SaMD-Class-IIa/IIb',
    FALSE,
    'GDPR+HIPAA-aligned',
    TRUE,
    TRUE
);
```

This captures the mandatory QMS and risk standards and hard-codes REM disallowance at the governance level.[^9_2][^9_3]

## SQL safety invariants and REM exclusion

```sql
-- filename: /sql/schema/neuro_ar_lab_v1_0_0.sql

CREATE TABLE ds_study (
    study_id              VARCHAR(64) PRIMARY KEY,
    protocol_code         VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
    pathway_type          VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL,  -- 'clinical-therapy' or 'non-sleep-research'
    sleep_stage_scope     VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL,  -- 'awake-only', 'NREM-only'
    rem_sleep_flag        BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at            TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    created_by_user_id    VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
    governance_profile_id VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL
        REFERENCES ds_governance_profile(profile_id),

    CONSTRAINT ck_ds_study_no_rem
        CHECK (rem_sleep_flag = FALSE AND sleep_stage_scope <> 'REM')
);
```

The check constraint turns REM exclusion into an invariant that cannot be overridden by application logic, consistent with inherent safety-by-design principles in ISO 14971.[^9_2]

***

## ALN REM exclusion policy behavior tree

```aln
filename: /aln/policies/rem_exclusion_policy_v1_0_0.aln

CREATE POLICY rem_exclusion_policy_v1_0_0 (
    INPUTS  (study_id, requested_sleep_stage, requested_flag_rem),
    OUTPUTS (policy_decision, policy_reason)
) BEHAVIOR_TREE

ROOT: SEQUENCE {
    NODE check_study_scope:
        IF requested_sleep_stage = 'REM' THEN
            SET policy_decision = 'DENY';
            SET policy_reason   = 'REM_NOT_PERMITTED';
            HALT;

    NODE check_flag_rem:
        IF requested_flag_rem = TRUE THEN
            SET policy_decision = 'DENY';
            SET policy_reason   = 'REM_FLAG_FORBIDDEN';
            HALT;

    NODE default_allow:
        SET policy_decision = 'ALLOW';
        SET policy_reason   = 'NON_REM_SCOPE';
        HALT;
};
```

This duplicates the SQL constraint at the policy layer, giving defense-in-depth across data, application, and governance strata.[^9_2]

***

## Calibration and traceability schema (ISO 13485 Clause 7.6)

    method               VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,  -- lab, field, ISO-traceable
    interval_days        INTEGER NOT NULL,
    tolerance_spec       VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL  -- structured tolerance definition
);

CREATE TABLE ds_calibration_record (
    calib_record_id      VARCHAR(64) PRIMARY KEY,
    device_id            VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL
        REFERENCES ds_device_asset(device_id),
    calib_profile_id     VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL
        REFERENCES ds_calibration_profile(calib_profile_id),
    calib_date           TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    calib_due_date       TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    result_pass          BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
    offset_value         NUMERIC(12,6),
    scale_value          NUMERIC(12,6),

);

CREATE INDEX idx_ds_calib_device_time
    ON ds_calibration_record (device_id, calib_date);
```

This schema supports full calibration traceability across devices, sites, and time, as required by ISO 13485 and used in multi-site XR/BCI trials.[^9_1][^9_2]

## Dual-pathway neuromorphic XR therapy constraints

```aln
filename: /aln/datashards/ds_dual_pathway_constraints_v1_0_0.aln

CREATE TABLE ds_therapy_pathway_constraint (
    pathway_id                 STRING PRIMARY KEY,  -- 'clinical-therapy', 'non-sleep-research'
    rem_allowed                BOOL,
    neuromorphic_mode          STRING,             -- 'edge-SNN-assist', 'analytics-only'
    allowed_sleep_stage_scope  STRING,             -- 'awake-only', 'NREM-only'
    eeg_channel_min            INT,
    eeg_channel_max            INT,
    xr_latency_ms_p95_max      REAL,
    xr_pose_error_cm_rms_max   REAL
);

INSERT INTO ds_therapy_pathway_constraint VALUES
(
    'clinical-therapy',
    FALSE,
    'edge-SNN-assist',
    'awake-only',
    16,
    64,
    50.0,
    1.0
),
(
    'non-sleep-research',
    FALSE,
    'analytics-only',
    'awake-only',
    8,
    32,
    70.0,
    2.0
);
```

These parameters bound neuromorphic XR behavior for each pathway and can be referenced at runtime to prevent protocol designs that could increase clinical risk (e.g., extending into REM).[^9_3]

***

## Java safety gate for session creation

```java
// filename: /java/med/dreamscape/SessionSafetyGate.java

package med.dreamscape;

public final class SessionSafetyGate {

    public static boolean isRemAllowedForPathway(
            String pathwayId,
            boolean requestedRemFlag,
            String requestedSleepStage
    ) {
        // For both clinical-therapy and non-sleep-research, REM is prohibited
        if ("REM".equalsIgnoreCase(requestedSleepStage)) {
            return false; // hard-coded invariant
        }
        if (requestedRemFlag) {
            return false; // prohibit explicit REM flag
        }
        // If future non-REM pathways are added, logic can extend here
        return !"REM".equalsIgnoreCase(requestedSleepStage);
    }

    public static boolean isDeviceCalibratedInDate(
            java.time.Instant now,
            java.time.Instant calibDueDate,
            boolean lastResultPass
    ) {
        if (!lastResultPass) {
            return false;
        }
        return now.isBefore(calibDueDate);
    }
}
```

This gate mirrors database and ALN invariants, ensuring that client-side orchestration cannot initiate REM-related sessions and that only in-date, passing calibrations are used in live therapy, conformant with safety-by-design and calibration control expectations in ISO 13485 and ISO 14971.[^9_3][^9_1][^9_2]

# Phased Regulatory Pathways and Clinical Validation Strategies for Insomnia Treatment

The development of DreamScape is structured as a progressive journey along a clear regulatory pathway, transforming a wellness-focused virtual reality (VR) relaxation tool into a cleared prescription digital therapeutic (PDT) for chronic insomnia. This phased approach allows the company to build a robust technology stack, gather preliminary data, and lay the groundwork for increasingly stringent regulatory submissions. The roadmap begins with Phase 1, focused on evidence-aligned VR relaxation modules marketed as a wellness product, which likely falls under Class I FDA regulations 910. While simpler from a regulatory perspective, this phase is strategically crucial for establishing a telemetry infrastructure, collecting usage metrics, and building a foundation of documentation that will be invaluable for future medical device positioning 21. Phase 2 marks the transition to a Software as a Medical Device (SaMD), introducing CBT-I inspired therapy sequences and a clinician dashboard 50. This step moves the product closer to a Class II classification, as it now performs a medical purpose—treating insomnia—without being part of a physical hardware device, a definition adopted by regulators worldwide 815. The feasibility and pilot studies conducted in this phase prepare the ground for seeking regulatory clearance as an adjunctive insomnia treatment, leveraging the precedent set by products like Somryst® 5568.

The true challenge and opportunity lie in Phases 3 and 4, where the introduction of EEG and closed-loop control represents a significant leap in risk and complexity. This evolution pushes the product towards a higher risk classification, potentially Class II or even Class III, depending on the specifics of the intervention and the potential consequences of failure 918. The ultimate goal of achieving regulatory-grade VR insomnia treatment status firmly places DreamScape in the category of a Prescription Digital Therapeutic (PDT), a sub-class of SaMD that delivers a therapeutic intervention and requires a physician's prescription for access 2163. The existence of FDA-cleared DTx products such as Somryst® (formerly SHUTi) and SleepioRx provides a detailed and actionable roadmap for this process 5862. These products were successfully cleared primarily through the 510(k) pathway, demonstrating substantial equivalence to a legally marketed predicate device and supported by extensive clinical trial data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving thousands of patients 556768. This precedent validates the chosen path and provides a clear target for the type and volume of clinical evidence required for submission.

Central to this entire process is the three-pillar clinical evaluation framework established by the International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF) and adopted by the FDA 6572. Any claim made by DreamScape, particularly those related to its neuromorphic EEG closed-loop features, must withstand scrutiny across three distinct domains. First, Valid Clinical Association requires establishing a scientific link between the technology's output (e.g., real-time arousal detection derived from EEG signals) and the targeted clinical condition of insomnia 72. This involves a thorough literature review and alignment with established clinical constructs, such as sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO), and total sleep time (TST) 54. Second, Analytical Validation is the technical proof that the software correctly and reliably processes input data (the raw EEG signal) to generate accurate and precise outputs (the arousal probability score) 1664. This phase would involve validating the performance of the neuromorphic classifier against a gold standard like polysomnography (PSG). The cited accuracy of 79% for the Sleeptracker-AI Monitor in epoch-by-epoch sleep staging provides a relevant benchmark for what can be expected from a non-clinical grade algorithm, highlighting the need for continuous refinement to meet the higher standards required for a medical device 35. Finally, Clinical Validation is the demonstration that the use of the technology leads to clinically meaningful outcomes in the target population 4072. This is the domain of traditional RCTs. The proposed validation study protocol for DreamScape is well-aligned with this framework, using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) as the primary endpoint, a measure shown to be effective in trials for existing DTx products 5860. Success in this final pillar is measured by quantifiable improvements in validated scales and adherence to benchmarks defined by clinical guidelines, such as the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), which recommends a clinically significant threshold of at least a 10-minute reduction in SOL 54.

The clinical validation strategy must also account for the nuances of insomnia treatment. EMA and FDA guidelines recommend trial durations of 4–8 weeks and often favor three-arm designs with placebo and active comparator arms 52. The choice of control arm is critical; for insomnia-focused DTx, a "sham" control is often achieved by removing disease-specific CBT content while retaining engagement structures, a method accepted by the FDA 61. Studies have shown that context-appropriate, non-therapeutic digital controls are feasible and accepted by regulators 58. The primary outcome, typically the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), is supplemented by secondary endpoints like sleep diary metrics (SOL, WASO), actigraphy-derived sleep measures, and validated anxiety/depression scales (e.g., GAD-7, PHQ-9) 4457. Adherence monitoring is also a key component, as seen in the Somryst protocol, which requires patients to complete a minimum number of sleep diaries to progress through treatment cores 5760. A robust statistical analysis plan, including intention-to-treat analysis and subgroup analyses, is essential to demonstrate efficacy conclusively 5360. By following this structured, evidence-based approach, DreamScape can navigate the complexities of SaMD regulation and establish itself as a safe and effective treatment for chronic insomnia.

Deep Dive into Technical Architecture: From Neuromorphic Inference to Secure Data Platforms
The technical architecture of DreamScape is a sophisticated, multi-layered system designed not only to deliver therapeutic value but also to meet the stringent demands of a medical device environment. The hierarchical structure, comprising clinical knowledgebases, therapy orchestration, neuromorphic inference, and a robust data platform, enables a phased development and regulatory pathway 921. The most forward-looking and technically demanding layer is the neuromorphic inference engine, which is responsible for processing real-time EEG data to detect arousal states and enable a closed-loop adaptation of the VR experience 32. This choice of technology is driven by the need for near-real-time, low-power inference directly on the headset or bedside unit, minimizing latency and power draw—a critical requirement for a wearable, always-on sensor system 3334. Event-driven neuromorphic hardware or accelerators, such as the Intel Loihi 2 chip capable of simulating billions of neurons, are ideal substrates for this task 33. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), the computational model underlying this hardware, process information through discrete, time-dependent spikes, allowing for asynchronous computation where periods of silence incur zero energy cost 34. This native synergy between SNNs and neuromorphic chips makes them exceptionally well-suited for the sparse, event-driven nature of EEG signals, enabling continuous sleep-onset detection with ultra-low power consumption 34.

However, the adoption of adaptive AI/ML presents unique challenges for regulatory compliance. To satisfy the traceability and documentation requirements of ISO 13485 and IEC 62304, the system must incorporate Good Machine Learning Practices (GMLP) and, critically, use explainable AI (XAI) models 1342. An opaque "black box" model would fail to meet regulatory expectations, as it would be impossible to verify the reasoning behind its outputs or track changes effectively. Therefore, the development process must integrate XAI techniques to make the neuromorphic classifier's decision-making process transparent and auditable 42. The closed-loop controller itself must operate within strict clinician-defined bounds, with a fallback mechanism to revert to conservative, simple relaxation content if the classifier confidence is low or unusual patterns are detected 32. All closed-loop decisions must be logged for later clinical review and algorithm audits, providing a complete and immutable record of the system's behavior 17. This logging capability is a core tenet of FDA guidance on electronic records, which emphasizes authenticity, integrity, and traceability throughout the full retention period 41.

The data platform and analytics layer serves as the backbone of the entire system, supporting both product telemetry and clinical analysis 30. It must be architected to handle a diverse range of data types, including de-identified therapy session logs, summaries of EEG and biosignals, sleep-stage trajectories, and validated outcome measures from sleep diaries and questionnaires 7. A clinical data lake and warehouse is the appropriate architecture for this, providing a scalable and organized store for this rich dataset 7. However, the most critical aspect of this layer is its implementation of privacy and security controls to comply with frameworks like HIPAA and GDPR 3771. Pseudonymization is a cornerstone of this strategy, defined as the replacement of direct identifiers while maintaining re-identification capability under controlled conditions 7. This privacy-by-design measure is mandated by major privacy laws and must be implemented rigorously. Tools like WiseSpace or Mainzelliste could be integrated to automate the de-identification process, applying configurable rules to remove or transform HIPAA identifiers and quasi-identifiers while classifying the re-identification risk 739. This ensures that sensitive health information is protected, yet the data remains useful for research and analytics when accessed by authorized personnel under controlled conditions.

Furthermore, the data platform must facilitate continuous learning and change control, particularly for the AI/ML components. The FDA's guidance on Predetermined Change Control Plans (PCCPs) offers a regulatory pathway for updating AI/ML-enabled SaMD post-market without requiring a new submission for every modification 3071. Beacon Biosignals' SleepStageML, an FDA-cleared ML software for sleep staging, includes an authorized PCCP that covers four types of modifications, from retraining the model with new data to updating signal processing steps 3069. DreamScape's architecture should be designed to support a similar PCCP. This requires a robust CI/CD pipeline that can automatically trigger predefined verification and validation testing whenever a new algorithm version is deployed. The system must include version tracking for both the VR app and the classifiers, along with rollback capabilities to quickly revert to a stable version in case of issues 7071. This secure update mechanism, coupled with a locked "clinical" model for production use and experimental branches for research, allows for iterative improvement while maintaining regulatory integrity and ensuring patient safety 71. The entire data infrastructure, from pseudonymization vaults to secure update servers, must be designed with these principles of privacy, traceability, and controlled change in mind to build a system that is not only clinically effective but also compliant and trustworthy.

Hardware, Usability, and Post-Market Surveillance Integration
The successful translation of the DreamScape software and algorithmic stack into a safe and effective clinical product hinges on the careful integration of hardware, usability engineering, and post-market surveillance (PMS) planning from the earliest stages of development. The hardware specification for a clinical-grade AR/BCI headset must extend beyond raw performance metrics to encompass factors critical for long-term use, especially in a home environment. Key specifications include high-resolution displays with a sufficient field of view and low motion-to-photon latency to minimize cybersickness, which is a known hazard identified in ISO 14971 risk management processes 650. Inside-out tracking with six degrees of freedom (6-DoF) is essential for immersive experiences, and the inclusion of external cameras may be necessary for certain clinical tracking scenarios 6. Ergonomics and hygiene are paramount; the headset must have adjustable fit and features like replaceable liners and cleanable surfaces to be suitable for multi-patient use in clinics 6. For the BCI component, an 8-32 channel dry or semi-dry EEG cap positioned to capture frontal and central activity is required for reliable sleep and arousal assessment 6. This must be complemented by integrated sensors for photoplethysmography (PPG) and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to refine sleep-stage detection through heart-rate variability (HRV) and movement metrics 6. On-board low-power compute, potentially augmented by a neuromorphic accelerator, is necessary to run the inference models locally, reducing latency and dependency on constant connectivity .

Usability engineering is a mandatory component of the risk management process under standards like ISO 14971 and is a key element of the FDA's Quality System Regulation 5051. This process ensures that the device is not only effective but also safe and intuitive for the intended users—the patients—with minimal supervision from clinicians 50. This involves conducting human-factors testing in realistic home environments to identify potential hazards related to misinterpretation of instructions, difficulty in setup, or adverse reactions like seizures or falls 50. The design of the user interface, the clarity of the instructions provided to patients, and the effectiveness of the clinician dashboard for monitoring patient progress are all critical areas of focus. For example, the XR runtime must include safety overlays, such as a clear way to abort a session, and cybersickness monitoring tools that can prompt the user to take a break if necessary 6. The entire system must be designed to be resilient, with robust physical design to minimize risks like cable entanglement, and electrical safety protocols aligned with medical device norms 6. The feedback gathered during usability testing is fed directly back into the risk management file, allowing for iterative design improvements that enhance both safety and user experience 51.

Post-market surveillance is not an afterthought but a core design requirement that must be planned for throughout the product lifecycle 70. Effective PMS is mandated proactively by both EU MDR and FDA regulations and is essential for identifying unforeseen risks, monitoring long-term performance, and fulfilling obligations for continued safety and effectiveness 5170. The architecture of DreamScape must be built to facilitate PMS from day one. This includes integrating features for remote monitoring, which allows for the real-time collection of physiological and performance data, as well as automated error and event reporting 70. Usage analytics are another critical component, providing insights into patient adherence, off-label use, and general system performance, all of which can be anonymized to protect patient privacy 70. The secure update mechanism is perhaps the most important PMS feature, as it allows for the rapid deployment of bug fixes, security patches, and minor improvements without compromising safety 71. This must be managed through a robust change control process, with clear communication plans for users about what changes are being implemented 69. The system should also be designed to autonomously collect real-world performance data, such as adverse events and end-user feedback, with minimal burden on the user, feeding this information back into the clinical evaluation and risk management processes 40. This continuous learning loop ensures that the product remains safe and effective long after its initial launch, a key expectation for modern SaMD 40. The ability to conduct real-world evidence generation is becoming increasingly important for regulatory authorities, and a well-designed PMS program is the foundation for generating this valuable data to support future regulatory submissions and maintain market authorization 70.

Strategic Synthesis: Coordinating Dual Architectures and Stakeholder Alignment
In conclusion, the provided materials outline a visionary and highly pragmatic blueprint for developing a next-generation neuromorphic XR therapy platform. The core strength of this strategy lies in its dual-pathway architecture, which simultaneously pursues two distinct markets under a unified governance structure. This approach allows the company to leverage its advanced technology in two ways: first, by developing the DreamScape sleep-therapy stack along a clear, defensible path toward FDA/EU MDR clearance as a prescription digital therapeutic for insomnia 2163; and second, by establishing the REM-excluded neuromorphic AR gait lab stack as a high-impact research platform for the academic and rehabilitation community 46. This diversification is a brilliant strategic move, mitigating risk by not placing all development resources on a single regulatory path while creating multiple revenue streams. The gait lab can serve as a proving ground for the platform's neuromorphic and biosensing capabilities, generating valuable data and establishing credibility in a less-regulated space, while the DreamScape stack is being meticulously prepared for the rigors of medical device approval. The unifying thread that binds these two divergent paths is the ISO 13485-compliant QMS, which ensures that all development activities, regardless of the target use case, adhere to the highest standards of quality, safety, and traceability 349.

The success of this ambitious project depends on the disciplined execution of this dual-pathway strategy and a deep, early integration of regulatory thinking into the agile development process. Agile methodologies can be effectively employed for software development, but they must be adapted to accommodate the waterfall-style regulatory gates required for design controls and risk management 46. The initial focus must be on establishing a robust QMS, creating a comprehensive Risk Management File per ISO 14971, and precisely defining the Intended Use, as this foundational document drives every subsequent decision regarding design, validation, and marketing claims 47. The hard-coded safety invariants, particularly the multi-layered exclusion of REM sleep, should be viewed not as a limitation but as a core competitive advantage. This proactive, defense-in-depth approach to risk management demonstrates a profound commitment to patient safety that will resonate strongly with regulatory bodies and clinical stakeholders alike, potentially simplifying the classification and review process for the insomnia treatment application 1747.

Finally, effective communication tailored to the needs of different stakeholders is essential for aligning all teams toward a common goal. The DreamScape_ResearchOrchestrator_v1_0_0 module correctly identifies the necessity of this tailored approach 46. For Regulatory Professionals, the conversation must center on the Quality Management System, the risk management file, and the clinical validation plan, demonstrating how the product meets all statutory and regulatory requirements. For Engineering Teams, the priority is the database schema, API definitions, CI/CD pipelines, and observability metrics that enable a compliant and scalable system. For Clinical Researchers, the emphasis must be on the study design, inclusion/exclusion criteria, validated outcome measures, and data quality protocols, assuring them that the platform is a reliable tool for generating meaningful clinical evidence 46. For mixed stakeholder groups, a layered communication strategy—providing executive summaries, regulatory detail, technical annexes, and protocol synopses—is necessary to ensure everyone understands their role in achieving the shared objective. By maintaining an unwavering commitment to the foundational principles of ISO 13485, leveraging the hard-coded safety invariants as a strategic asset, and fostering clear, stakeholder-aligned communication, the project team can successfully navigate the complex journey from a promising concept to a world-class, clinically grounded neuromorphic XR therapy.

This description already matches current regulatory and technical expectations for neuromorphic XR insomnia therapy; it mainly needs structuring into clearly implementable phases, artifacts, and invariants.

***

## Hard‑coded safety invariants (REM exclusion)

- Design principle: treat REM exclusion as a non‑overrideable, multi-layer safety control, not a configurable option.
- Enforcement layers:
    - Governance: product definitions and Intended Use strictly limited to awake and sleep‑onset relaxation; REM excluded from risk-benefit claims and clinical protocols.
    - Data model: no REM session labels or flags permitted; schema-level constraints (e.g., allowed values for sleep stage scope limited to “awake”, “N1–N3”, or aggregated non‑REM buckets).
    - Application logic: explicit deny paths in session-creation and protocol-selection logic whenever REM is requested or inferred.
    - Hardware/protocol: no sensing or actuation designed specifically for REM; AR/XR runtimes configured for pre‑sleep and early night, not full-night REM tracking.
- Regulatory rationale: reduces hazards around dream content manipulation, seizure triggering, or psychological instability, helping keep risk profile within typical Class II SaMD/PDT expectations.

***

## Clinical validation aligned with IMDRF three-pillar model

- Valid Clinical Association
    - Map XR/EEG outputs (e.g., arousal index, relaxation adherence, HRV-derived arousal markers) to insomnia constructs such as SOL, WASO, TST, and ISI scores.
    - Ground in existing sleep medicine and CBT‑I literature; specify hypotheses like “reduction in pre‑sleep arousal index predicts ISI improvement.”
- Analytical Validation
    - Signal pipeline: EEG + PPG + IMU → feature extraction → neuromorphic classifier (SNN or equivalent).
    - Validate against PSG or expert-labeled data for arousal detection and sleep‑onset estimation.

## Technical architecture and neuromorphic inference

- Neuromorphic inference layer
    - Hardware: event‑driven neuromorphic accelerator (e.g. Loihi‑class) or ultra‑low‑power SNN runtime on the XR device / bedside hub.
    - Model: SNN or spiking-inspired model tuned for sparse EEG events; designed for sub‑second latency and low energy per inference.
    - Boundaries: clinician-configurable safe ranges for stimulus modulation; hard limits on maximum intensity or rate of change; automatic fallback to static, conservative relaxation content upon low confidence or anomaly detection.
- Explainable AI and ML lifecycle
    - Model transparency: use interpretable features or post‑hoc XAI methods to provide clinicians with insight into why the system labeled a segment as “arousal”.
    - Documentation: data sources, preprocessing steps, training/validation splits, performance, and limitations stored under ISO 13485 / IEC 62304 controls.
    - Change management: explicit ML lifecycle with locked clinical models, separate research branches, and a documented PCCP for post‑market updates.
- Data platform and privacy
    - Architecture: clinical data lake + warehouse holding de‑identified session logs, derived EEG features, staging outputs, and outcomes; linkage keys kept in a separate, access-controlled service.
    - Privacy-by-design: pseudonymization, minimization of raw signals retained, role‑based access, encryption, and detailed audit trails for data access and changes.
    - Compliance: align with HIPAA, GDPR (and similar) by documenting lawful basis, retention schedules, subject rights workflows (access, correction, deletion), and cross‑border transfer controls.

## Hardware, usability, and post‑market surveillance

- Hardware specification
    - XR: low motion‑to‑photon latency, sufficient FOV, inside‑out 6‑DoF tracking, and ergonomics suitable for home and clinic use.
    - BCI: 8–32 channel dry or semi‑dry EEG targeting frontal/central leads, plus PPG and IMU for multi‑modal sleep and arousal estimation.
    - Compute: on‑device or near‑device low‑power inference hardware plus secure connectivity for telemetry and updates.
- Usability and human factors
    - Iterative human‑factors studies in clinic and home-like environments to identify risk-prone interactions (setup difficulty, confusing alerts, cybersickness, falls).
    - Safety UI features: clear abort/stop controls, symptom prompts (e.g. nausea, headache), pacing of therapy modules, and support for caregiver oversight when needed.
    - Integration with risk management: usability findings logged as hazards or contributing factors in the ISO 14971 risk file, closing the loop between testing and design updates.
- Post‑market surveillance (PMS)
    - Mechanisms: remote monitoring, automated error/event reporting, patient‑reported outcome capture, and adherence analytics.
    - Real‑world evidence: continuous aggregation of outcome and safety data into a structured registry or real‑world evidence framework to support renewals, label updates, and new indications.
    - Update pipeline: secure OTA updates with cryptographic signing, version tracking, rollback, and explicit communication to users and clinicians; PCCP defines which ML and software changes fall within the authorized envelope.

***

## Strategic coordination of dual architectures

- Dual path:
    - PDT insomnia stack: aligned to FDA/EU MDR expectations, strict REM exclusion, rigorous trial program.
    - REM‑excluded AR gait lab stack: higher flexibility for research on neuromorphic monitoring and XR rehabilitation, but under the same QMS and safety invariants.
- Governance and communication:
    - Single ISO 13485 QMS covering both paths, with shared risk management and calibration infrastructures.
    - Tailored communication artefacts for regulatory, clinical, engineering, and commercial stakeholders, all anchored on a common Intended Use and safety narrative (especially REM exclusion and closed‑loop guardrails).

As long as the implementation remains tightly bound to these principles—hard safety invariants, IMDRF three‑pillar validation, neuromorphic/XAI discipline, and continuous PMS—the platform can move from wellness XR to a neuromorphic, prescription‑grade insomnia therapeutic without breaking regulatory or safety expectations.
