AI-Human-Integrated-Technology (AIHIT) Licensing Regime is hereby constituted as a specialized, open-permissive, bio-compatible, and AI-augmented software and systems license family, modeled for simplicity on permissive open-source instruments while embedding advanced, multi-jurisdictional protections for augmented users, neurotech environments, and superintelligence-governed infrastructures.

## Section 1 – Definitions

1.1 “AIHIT Work” means any software, firmware, hardware description, protocol, documentation, model, dataset, interface, neuromorphic or isomorphic configuration, or integration pattern that is (a) substantially enabled by, or materially dependent on, artificial intelligence or machine-learning components, and (b) designed for or capable of operation in bio-compatible, BCI, EEG, neuromorphic, organic, nano-tech, or cyber-physical environments, including augmented-user platforms and smart-grid / AU infrastructure.

1.2 “Augmented User” means any natural person whose cognition, perception, movement, or decision-making is directly or indirectly supported, enhanced, or mediated by AIHIT Work, including via AI chat systems, BCI interfaces, neuromorphic devices, nanoswarm/superintelligence orchestration, or AI-governed smart-city / AU infrastructure.

1.3 “Integrated Use” means any deployment in which AIHIT Work: (a) processes biological, neurological, or biometric signals; (b) closes control loops over physical or organic actuators; or (c) participates in governance, decision-support, or risk-bearing operations involving human welfare, infrastructure, finance, or legal rights.

1.4 “Public Repository” means a source-controlled codebase or documentation collection (including GitHub or equivalent) that is accessible to the public and which hosts AIHIT Work under this License with complete, current, and non-obfuscated documentation of core functionalities, safety constraints, and licensing status.

1.5 “Compliance Nexus” means any governance, logging, identity, or policy-enforcement fabric (including but not limited to ComplianceNexus, SwarmNet, nanoswarm governance, Web5-DID-based identity, and ALN-governed superintelligence enforcement layers) configured to (a) bind AIHIT Work to explicit legal terms, (b) preserve immutable evidence, and (c) enforce safety, provenance, and attribution rules in machine-enforceable form.

## Section 2 – Grant of Rights

2.1 Subject to full, continuous compliance with this License, each Contributor hereby grants to every Recipient a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, irrevocable (except as provided in Section 10) license to: (a) use, reproduce, and display the AIHIT Work; (b) modify, adapt, and create derivative works; (c) compile, transform, and integrate into neuromorphic, BCI, organic, nano, or cyber-physical stacks; and (d) distribute Source or Object forms, including via Public Repositories, for research, education, prototyping, and production deployments in AIHIT Fields of Use.

2.2 The foregoing grant extends to Integrated Use for self-experimentation, research, academic, and community-shared projects, provided that: (a) all applicable medical, data protection, and safety regulations are observed in each jurisdiction; (b) Augmented Users give informed, revocable consent with a clear description of AI involvement and risks; and (c) a Compliance Nexus is in active operation for logging and rollback of material changes.

2.3 No trademark rights, publicity rights, or rights to represent any Contributor, Doctor Jacob Scott Farmer, or associated entities are granted except as strictly necessary to reproduce factual attribution statements and SPDX-style license identifiers.

## Section 3 – Obligations for Public Repositories and Documentation

3.1 Any Public Repository hosting AIHIT Work MUST: (a) include this License text or an approved AIHIT license variant in the root LICENSE file; (b) include a human-readable README describing AIHIT integration scope, intended bio/BCI/neuro/organic interfaces, and known safety boundaries; and (c) declare all external platform TOS/EULA dependencies which materially affect end-user rights or data flows.

3.2 Architectural and compliance documentation MUST: (a) describe Integrated Use decision-points, safety interlocks, and kill-switch / rollback mechanisms; (b) identify whether any superintelligence, nanoswarm, or governance fabric is required for safe operation; and (c) specify which modules are permissive, which are proprietary, and which are subject to additional regulatory approvals (e.g., medical device rules).

3.3 Workflows that mutate repository structure (directory paths, file names, auto-refactors, code-generation pipelines) MUST maintain provenance metadata and immutable audit logs sufficient to reconstruct the origin, authorship, and licensing status of any AI-generated or human-generated artifact.

## Section 4 – Rights-to-Process and Data Governance

4.1 Rights-to-Process: Subject to applicable law and explicit, informed consent of affected natural persons, Recipients MAY process biological, neurological, biometric, or behavioral data with AIHIT Work for research, diagnostic-adjacent, or augmentation-adjacent purposes, provided that: (a) data minimization, encryption, and strict access controls are applied; (b) personal data processing aligns with frameworks such as GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA, EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF, and ISO 42001 where applicable; and (c) processing logic is documented in the repository.

4.2 Rights-to-Licensing: Recipients MAY combine AIHIT Work with other licensed components, including permissive or copyleft works, but SHALL maintain clear license boundaries, SPDX identifiers, and compatibility mapping; where conflict arises, Recipients MUST either (a) segregate incompatible modules behind defined interfaces, or (b) refrain from distribution.

4.3 Usage Control: When AIHIT Work affects or may affect bodily integrity, cognition, or essential services, Recipients MUST implement conditional access controls (identity verification, KYC/AML for financial flows, role-based privileges) and must log all configuration changes and critical decisions to a tamper-evident ledger.

## Section 5 – Safety, Risk, and Augmented-User Protections

5.1 Integrated Use Constraints: Any deployment that writes to, stimulates, or modulates neural, muscular, or sensory systems via BCI, neuromorphic devices, EMS, nano-interfaces, or organic actuators MUST: (a) implement human-in-the-loop supervision for any non-trivial decision making; (b) support immediate safe-stop and rollback procedures; and (c) expose Augmented Users to clear, prominent warnings regarding experimental status and residual risks.

5.2 Safety Baseline: Recipients MUST adopt minimally the following: continuous monitoring for anomalous behavior; audit logs with multi-year retention; fail-safe rollback triggers on detection of unsafe states; and periodic independent review of model bias, robustness, and explainability for any AI component influencing human health, safety, or fundamental rights.

5.3 Prohibited Behaviors: The License does not authorize any use of AIHIT Work for: (a) coercive or non-consensual behavioral manipulation; (b) unauthorized medical practice or clinical deployment without required approvals; (c) oppressive surveillance or discrimination against protected classes; or (d) intentional degradation of an Augmented User’s autonomy or cognitive sovereignty.

## Section 6 – Governance, Compliance Nexus, and Multi‑Jurisdictional Routing

6.1 Governance Encoding: Recipients deploying AIHIT Work at scale, in critical infrastructure, or in superintelligence-governed environments MUST encode core governance parameters—roles, quorum thresholds, override rights, emergency shutdown, and jurisdictional applicability—as machine-enforceable fragments (e.g., .SAI, .ALN, or equivalent) bound to cryptographic identities.

6.2 Multi-Jurisdictional Routing: Where data, users, or infrastructure span multiple jurisdictions, Recipients MUST: (a) declare governing law and dispute-forum in their own terms; (b) perform export-control and sanctions checks for cross-border AIHIT deployments; and (c) honor local medical, data, and device regulations in each effective territory.

6.3 Evidence and Auditability: All materially relevant enforcement actions, failures, rollbacks, or near-miss safety incidents MUST be recorded as evidentiary bundles (including hashes, timestamps, and signers) suitable for arbitration or court processes and resistant to tampering via cryptographic anchoring.

## Section 7 – Attribution, IP, and Superintelligence Enforcement

7.1 Attribution: Recipients MUST preserve original authorship and licensing notices in Source and documentation; where AIHIT Work is embedded into larger stacks, attribution MUST remain visible and machine-discoverable, including SPDX identifiers and DID-based claims where used.

7.2 IP Reservation: Except for the license grant in Section 2, all intellectual property rights remain with the respective rightsholders, including but not limited to Doctor Jacob Scott Farmer and associated entities for superintelligence-enforcement architectures, ALN-based compliance kernels, and nanoswarm governance designs.

7.3 Superintelligence Enforcement: Nothing in this License limits the right of a Compliance Nexus or superintelligence-governed enforcement fabric, configured by the rightsholder, to (a) detect license violations; (b) log and preserve evidence; (c) issue automated notices; and (d) prepare legal materials for injunctive or damages actions under applicable law.

## Section 8 – Warranty Disclaimer

8.1 AIHIT Work is provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE”, without any warranty of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, including any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, accuracy, safety, or suitability for medical or life-critical applications.

8.2 Contributors do not warrant that AIHIT Work will comply with any particular regulatory framework in any jurisdiction; Recipients bear sole responsibility for assessing and achieving such compliance before and during deployment.

## Section 9 – Limitation of Liability and Indemnity

9.1 To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall any Contributor be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages, nor for lost profits, data loss, bodily injury, or death arising from or related to any use or inability to use AIHIT Work, whether in contract, tort, or other theory, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

9.2 Where mandatory law imposes non-excludable liability, such liability shall be strictly limited to the amount the Recipient actually paid, if any, to obtain AIHIT Work.

9.3 Recipients agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Contributors from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or relating to: (a) Integrated Use in violation of this License; (b) non-compliance with applicable medical, safety, or data-protection laws; or (c) misrepresentation of AIHIT Work’s capabilities or approvals to Augmented Users, regulators, or third parties.

## Section 10 – Termination and Survival

10.1 This License terminates automatically for a Recipient upon any material breach, including but not limited to removal of required notices, misuse in prohibited contexts, or deliberate disabling of required safety or governance mechanisms, without prejudice to any other rights of Contributors.

10.2 Upon termination, Recipient must cease use and distribution of AIHIT Work and, where feasible, remove or disable deployed copies, provided that obligations concerning attribution, confidentiality (where applicable), limitation of liability, and evidentiary preservation survive.

10.3 A Recipient that cures a remediable breach in full and can evidence such cure MAY, at the discretion of the pertinent rights holder, have license rights reinstated prospectively in writing or via signed governance fragments.

## Section 11 – Relationship to Other Licenses

11.1 AIHIT License is intended to be permissive and MIT-like in spirit for non-integrated or low-risk uses, while adding mandatory safety, governance, and multi-jurisdictional obligations for Integrated Use and Augmented-User contexts.

11.2 Where AIHIT Work is combined with third-party components governed by other licenses, Recipients are solely responsible for ensuring compatibility and compliance; no interpretation of this License shall be construed to override or excuse obligations under other valid licenses or regulatory instruments.

11.3 In the event of irreconcilable conflict between this License and non-negotiable statutory safety or medical requirements, the latter prevails, and Recipient MUST adjust deployment or refrain from use accordingly.
